    <h3>Development process</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Looking back, to me, it seems natural
            divide the development process of this excersice to 2 phases. 
            The first consists of designing the app, while the second phase dealt with 
            implementing the user management system and scailing up the routing system.

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            So, this part was not easy. I got to thinking about how I'm not happy with
            the design of my last submission and decided I want to re-do it. I found a 
            design for a login/register page that looked good and used it. I ran into some trouble
            when trying to understand how to use their style inorder to create my app's maing page.
            Eventualy I've managed to use it, but I don't think it's too good of a fit for the 
            purpse of this app and I inted to reset it once more for the next submission.
            I did end up having a lot of fun; and honestly, once I saw something pretty,
            It got me quite motivated to keep going and do something really cool up ahead.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Scailing</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            Much like it's predecessor; this phase wasn't a small bundle of joy either.
            I think the major hardship about this part was that I did not understand what was
            I doing well enough. The gap between "this is working" and "I understand this tool
            and am able to get it to do what ever I want it to" is quite large.
            Additionaly, I had a hard time designing a "rich" architechture. That is; 
            There were a lot of decisions to be made, where I was unaware of the fact
            that there's a decision to make, let alone what might the right choice be, 
            or what are the implications of eachi desicion.
