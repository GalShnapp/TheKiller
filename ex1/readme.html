    <p>My main page is a simple list editor where you can suggest ideas
        for my next EX's design.
        <br> 
        by default, the server is initiated with 2 ideas.
        you can add new ideas, and remove\edit existing ideas!
        <br> 
        just click on the relevent button.

            The hardest part, on my case - was that since I lack experience
            with UI\ E2E app devolpment 
            <br>
             it took me a long while to understand
            I first need to have a vision => and only then would I be able
            to give it life.
            <br>
             I kept writing code and deleting it cus I didn't have
            a clear path ahead of me. It was only after I saw some designs online that 
            <br>
            I had a picture of what I was going for. Once that happend - things were pretty
            straight forward.

            to get going, run "server.js" using node.
            then, go to "http://127.0.0.1:8081/ideas.html" and enjoy.
